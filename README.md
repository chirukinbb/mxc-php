### It is recommended that you read the official document first

Mxc docs [https://github.com/mxcdevelop/APIDoc](https://github.com/mxcdevelop/APIDoc)

All interface methods are initialized the same as those provided by okex. See details [src/api](https://github.com/zhouaini528/mxc-php/tree/master/src/Api)

Many interfaces are not yet complete, and users can continue to extend them based on my design. Welcome to improve it with me
